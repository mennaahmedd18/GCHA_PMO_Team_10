Conflict resolution
- When a disagreement arises that team leaders are unable to resolve, a meeting will be held to discuss the issue collaboratively. If the disagreement persists after the meeting, the decision recommended by the team leader will be implemented based on what they determine to be in the best interest of the project. Should the disagreement still remain unresolved, the issue will be documented and escalated to the Teaching Assistant (TA) for further guidance and a final decision
